# Science Adventure series All in One universal extractor (Original description)

This project aims to unify and simplify the process of extracting science adventure visual novels for non-technical people.
Simply select a profile, point it to your install, select an output folder, and press go!
Windows and Linux systems are supported. Linux requires mono or wine to use some features.

To extract CPK files (Chaos;Head Noah, Robotics;Notes Elite and DaSH) an extra download of [CriPakTools.exe](https://github.com/esperknight/CriPakTools) is necessary.

You can download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/UNF0RM4TT3D/SciAdvAIOExtract/releases) section.

MPV is generally able to recognise the format on even unknown video and audio files (if run from terminal). So if you want to extract A/V MPV or other software capable of detecting media formats is strongly recommended.

This project is mostly licensed under the GNU GPL-v3 License, apart from files contained in the libs folder (MIT) and [FreeMote By UlyssesWu](https://github.com/UlyssesWu/FreeMote) (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0), this means that you cannot use the extractor commercially for extracting Anonymous;Code or other psb.m
