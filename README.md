Windows and Linux systems are supported. Linux requires mono or wine to use some features.

To extract CPK files (Chaos;Head Noah, Robotics;Notes Elite and DaSH) an extra download of [CriPakTools.exe](https://github.com/esperknight/CriPakTools) is necessary. You can download the latest release from the releases section.

MPV is generally able to recognise the format on even unknown video and audio files (if run from terminal). So if you want to extract A/V MPV or other software capable of detecting media formats is strongly recommended.
